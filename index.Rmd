<h3>About Me:</h3>

<p>Hi! My name is Angela Huynh, and I am an aspiring data scientist from San Diego, California.</p>
<p>I graduated from </b> UC Santa Barbara </b> with a B.S. in Statistical Science and a B.A. in Sociology. I am currently a data analyst in Costa Mesa, California with plans to obtain a masters degree in business analytics or statistics.</p>
I have research experience with confidential, real-world health data, with current research interests in:
<ul>
<li>psychology
<li>sociology
<li>social media
<li>consumer/marketing insights
</ul>

I hope to combine my sociological imagination as well as my statistical skills to make an impact through the projects I do. Some of my extracurricular interests include yoga, swimming, eating & making food, and running (sometimes).
