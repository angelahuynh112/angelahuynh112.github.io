## About Me:

Hi! My name is Angela Huynh and Iâ€™m from San Diego, California. I went to undergrad at the University of California, Santa Barbara and graduated with a B.S. in Statistical Science and a B.A. in Sociology. I'm currently pursuing my masters degree in biostatistics at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, TN. 

I hope to combine my sociological imagination as well as my statistical skills to make an impact through the projects I do. I am particularly interested in pursuing a career in data science; my current research interests remain very open. I find myself fascinated with sociological and consumer data, but also am curious about neurological (imaging) data. 

I am an active swimmer, yogi, ex-triathlete, maker and consumer of food.
